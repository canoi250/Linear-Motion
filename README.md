# Linear-Motion
# In this project, we will collect linear acceleration data using our phones and an app like the Physics Toolbox Sensor. 
We will explore the different types of insights we can extrapolate from that data using analysis
#We will explore the different types of insights we can extrapolate from that data using analysis and visualization.
We will be using numpy to analyze the data and matplotlib to visualize the data.
